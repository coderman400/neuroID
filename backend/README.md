Here’s a quick README snippet for your simulated backend:

## Simulated Backend – README

This backend was developed purely for **simulation purposes** to demonstrate the authentication and verification pipeline of the proposed decentralized digital identity system.

- ✅ **Language**: Python
- 🧪 **Purpose**: Prototype the flow of biometric registration and authentication (e.g., embedding generation, encryption, IPFS interaction, comparison logic).
- 🧑‍💻 **Note**: In a **real-world deployment**, these operations would **take place on the user’s device**, ensuring that sensitive biometric data never leaves the client-side environment. This simulated backend is only used here for ease of demonstration and testing.
